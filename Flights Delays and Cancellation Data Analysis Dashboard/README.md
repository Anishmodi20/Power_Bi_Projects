# Flight Delays and Cancellation Data Analysis Dashboard

## Introduction:
This Power Bi project aims to  analyse the flight delays and cancellations(Dec 2019 & Dec 2020) data to find out the biggest reason for flight arrival delay and flight cancellation.

## About the dataset:
This dataset contains the airport name, airport codename, carrier name, no. of arrival flights, no. of flights delayed, total arrival delay time. It also contains the no. of flights delayed and total arrival delay time due to various reasons i.e, security breach, bad weather, carrier delay, air traffic(nas), late aircraft delay.

## Insights:

•	Airports like ALT, DFW, ORD etc. has the highest no. of flights arriving.

•	Airlines like Southwest Airlines Co., Delta Air LInes Inc., SkyWest Airlines Inc., etc. has the highest numbers of flights operating.

•	Airports like DFW, ORD, DEN has the highest no. of flights arriving late or being delayed.

•	A total of 83.36 % aircrafts were cancelled and 16.64% were diverted.

•	Most no. of the flights were delayed due to late aircraft delay, air traffic, carrier delay.

•	Maximum no. of the delay(in minutes) faced by the aircraft were due to late aircraft delay, carrier delay, air traffic.

## Conclusion:
This Power BI project aims to create a comprehensive flight delays and cancelaltion analysis dashboard using the provided dataset. By visualizing the data through various perspectives, the dashboard will enable users to gain valuable insights into the various reasons of flight delays and cancellations. It will help the airlines and the airports to make data driven decison and optimize their management strategies to reduce flight delays and cancellations.
